/* 
  Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
  newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
  is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
  chessboard.
  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
